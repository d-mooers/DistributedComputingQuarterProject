I just purchased it 4 months ago, and I have had some things change in my life and need to unload it. There is NOTHING wrong with it and I actually do love the Jeep! It still carries the factory warranty that is transferrable to a new owner with the ability to purchase an extended warranty. It is a Gladiator with the Mojave package and it rides like it's on air.  The Fox Racing suspension was definitely worth the money and the drive train is strong. The only thing I have done to it have been the AUX switches which are Mopar and installed the Mopar tonneau cover on the back. I am selling it at what I believe is an extremely fair price.

It is in excellent condition inside and out and has a fantastic carfax with the same owner here in Alabama since 11k miles.  This Camry has only 143k miles on it and it has all the luxuries you need with all power, factory mats, both factory keys and remotes, cruise, a nice set of matching tires and so much more.  Plus it has just been serviced bumper to bumper and has a new cabin air filter, engine air filter, new valve cover gasket, new motor mount and a fresh tires rotation and balance.  Please do not hesitate to text or call me with any questions you may have.  My price is firm but fair and the good news is I have no doc fees or admin charges... just the 3.875% sales tax and the 18 dollar title fee.  I also have the title and carfax in hand.  Good luck on your search for a Camry... you may want to check this one out.",al,33.353975,-86.866536,2020-12-01T08:48:34-0600

This truck is in excellent condition, fully loaded with just under 81,000 miles and always garaged. The pictures I have attached were taken 10/03/2020. You must see this truck to really appreciate the like new condition. The exterior color is called Lava Metallic which contains three different Metallic colors and really pops out in the sun. The interior color is Lava red and black and has motorcycle-jacket-inspired seats, a unique gauge treatment, piano-black trim, soft plastic accents. Chrome flourishes are limited to the grill and power running-board edge. The wheels are 22"" with the Harley logo and Nitto Terra G2 tires. The Motor is a 5.4 liter V-8 with plenty of power attached to a 6-speed transmission. I added Husky floor liners in the front and back of the floor boards. There are no tears or rips in the interior and the carpet is like new. You will not find a truck in this condition with these low miles for under $30,000 so the price is firm. This truck was $55,000 in 2010. This is a serious truck for someone looking for a like new truck without the new truck price.

Go Kart is like new. I bought it for my son. He has driven it a total of maybe 10 times.  He wouldn't get in it anymore because he had mistakenly pressed the gas pedal full throttle one time when taking off . Now he wants nothing do with it. It set so long I had to put a new disc brake assembly on it. I also have a  Pro Series 63153 Rambler Cargo Carrier Basket For 2 Inch Trailer with lights and connector pin to go along with it. It also is like new.,al,33.3813,-86.7046,2020-11-29T14:15:33-0600

This one is loaded with the Sport package and the upgraded 14-speaker Ban & Olefsen sound system. I am purchasing these directly from VW/Audi and they come with a terrific warranty from Audi covering many items (see last photos for information regarding warranty). This 2015 A3 is covered for 11 years or 162,000 miles! Engine, turbo, entire fuel system and more are covered under this warranty. I don't think you can find a better deal out there right now than these TDI's being released back on the market after their emissions scandal. This A3 has had it's emissions system updated by Audi and any recalls taken care of. I am a small licensed dealer, but I am taking full advantage of the opportunity to purchase as many TDI's as I can right now and have about 30 TDI's to choose from. I also do not charge documentation fees that other dealers will add to your final price.   Thanks, Greg 205 567-5125  I do have many other TDI's.

It is a one owner with low mileage that has been here in Alabama all of its life.  It has just been serviced and has almost new front brakes and new rear rotors and pads, brand new engine air filter, new cabin air filter and an excellent set of matching BF Goodrich tires.  Plus all the luxuries you need with IPOD aux plug, audio controls on the steering wheel, sunroof, alloys, both factory keys, factory mats and so much more.  My price is fair but firm and the good news is there are not doc fees or admin charges... just the 3.875% sales tax and the 18 dollar title fee.  I have the title and carfax in hand.

For some reason the images are blurry and it won't let me change it, I can send them directly to you   It was my brother's car and I am the second owner.   We both took care of it well.  Normal wear and tear on paint, nothing major, some moderate curbing of rims you can see in the pictures it's not terrible.  I don't want to get rid of it but we need an SUV ASAP, so I have priced it accordingly.  Has check engine light on (p0101) this is an O2 sensor that is cheap and easy to switch.  Mods(all corksport): Axle-back exhaust Short ram intake Rear Motor mount Mudflaps Fuel pump Weighted shifter  Runs great, and is a fun little car to drive, I use it as my daily because the drone of the axle-back is minimal.  Asking $8000 obo. It's already lower than anything similar on the market so don't lowball. Willing to talk anytime.",al,33.3813,-86.7046,2020-11-24T15:54:14-0600

This van is in great running condition, and is very clean for it's age. I bought it in 2016 and have given it a full once-over. This one is the real deal. It has the 350ci V8, 4L60E transmission with tow package. This is a ""2500"" series heavy duty commercial van. Working front and rear AC/Heat. Electronic sofa / bed. Storage compartments, mood lights, all the standards for conversion vans of that era. The high top does not have skylights so this van has not had water damage and does not smell moldy like a lot of them do. The odometer reading is a little less than actual miles, due to it failing and being repaired a few thousand miles later. Actual miles on the van is approx 173k. Although not pictured, the middle captains chairs are included. Runs VERY smooth. Does not smoke at all. Shifts perfectly. I would easily trust this van for another cross country trip.  Here is some of the work that's recently been done to it. -Interior carpet removed and replaced with new carpet up front (black), and vinyl plank in the mid/rear. Interior upholstery steam cleaned. (all done in 2017) -New fuel pump 2017 (AC Delco) -New water pump 2019 (AC Delco) -New water hoses and heater hoses (2017) -New serpentine belt, spare included (2017) -New alternator 2017 -New plugs and distributor cap (delco) and wires (forgot the brand) -Rebuilt AC Compressor (2017) -New battery (2017) -New rear main seal (2017) -New brake rotors/calipers/hoses (2016/2017) -All new tires (2020) -New wiper blades (2020) -Pioneer cd player  Here is some info about the condition -Runs very well (just got done with a 6250 mile trip around the western US). -Most features work -I've made a point to change the oil/filter every 3000 miles. -I can provide paperwork for most of the work that I've done  Here are some of the issues it has -Front master cylinder needs replaced (I already have a spare. I may replace it, or may leave it up to the buyer.) -The brakes are the main issue that will need to be fixed on this van. -Minor body rust in a couple of places (although the van has been in the south for a long time, maybe it's whole life) -Wipers sometimes get ""confused"" as to which setting they're supposed to be on, but will always turn on / off. -Needs to have the wiper fluid reservoir connected (i have it) -Oil cooler lines bypassed with Melling oil filter adapter. OK if you're not towing. If you are, the hoses are easy and inexpensive to replace to reconnect to the oil cooler (i have the original adapter as well) -Very small transmission fluid leak off rear seal (common problem, very small) -Very small water leak from intake manifold gasket, front driver side -Small exhaust leak from right side header (small ticking sound when engine loaded, quiet during cruising) -Hole rusting in muffler toward the rear, causes the van to be a little louder than normal.  I live in Birmingham, AL, which is were this van is located. It has a clear Alabama title in my name. I'm listing it in several cities on the west coast, due to increased demand for vans in those areas. Buyer can drive it back, or we can arrange to have it shipped (approx $1800 or so) to the west coast.  Please feel free to contact me via the craigslist email and then we can talk on the phone if you're a serious buyer.",al,33.4951,-86.8059,2020-11-24T07:27:03-0600

I am the second owner and bought the car in late 2017 with only 2700 miles on it.  Now has just under 25k miles.  Clean title.  Never had any issues.  No accidents.  Adult driven, never raced.  Used mainly as a commuter.  I have logged all maintenance data.  MSRP with options was over $32k.      Cool fact: The TRD wheels and exhaust were port-installed before it reached the dealership.  Does have factory navigation.  Has OEM rubber floor mats with the 86 logo.  Also have an OEM trunk mat with the 86 logo.  I replaced the tires with fresh Continental DWS06 this summer, so those have little mileage on them.  Other things to note, I've changed the differential and transmission oil twice already with Motul 300.  I've changed the engine oil every 5000 miles, currently using Pennzoil Platinum 0W20.  Just recently did the clutch fluid and brake fluid. Also completed a clay bar, polish, and paint sealant treatment this fall.  I've taken only the best care of this car.  It needs nothing but a skilled driver.  Here are the subtle but effective modifications I've made:  Whiteline rear subframe bushings Whiteline differential bushings Whiteline transmission mount insert Perrin transmission support mount Perrin shifter mount bushing MTEC shifter springs MTEC clutch spring MTEC clutch line Racer X oil catch can Racer X sound tube delete Racer X reverse lockout Grimmspeed drop in air filter  I have all original parts, so you could make the car 100% stock again if you chose to do so, but why?  These mods have made the car come alive, and it is so direct.  It feels special.    If you are interested, feel free to reach me by phone or email.  I'm happy to show the car, but to serious buyers only who know how to drive a manual.",al,33.3967,-86.8346,2020-11-23T00:11:50-0600

Serving customers nationwide ~ We make nationwide sales and logistics simple! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHY IS A SMALL RV OR CAMPERVAN BETTER THAN A LARGE RV?  Small Motor Home / Class B advantages why look closely at the Transit Connect Campervan?:  1. Better fuel economy  2. Camper vans are easier to drive than a big motorhome  3. Can go through any car wash- easy to keep clean inside and outside clean- smaller is better  4. Can access smaller roads and dirt roads leading to ""out of the way"" dispersed camping opportunities  5. Can take a nap, get some sleep rest wherever parking is allowed.  6. With a small RV you can and drive your vehicle to explore the area and your RV home and food is always with you so you can save on restaurant meals. With a larger RV you would need to leave it behind and take a second- pulled behind vehicle to enable parking and exploring  7. A camper van will go anywhere a car can go- garage, parking garage, small roads, parking in busy cities or high brush areas with low trees.  8. If, while exploring, you find a great overnight spot, you can stay without having to backtrack to get your RV.  9. Storage is enough for most people, with less storage space you tend to bring less ""stuff"" you will likely not use and be less tempted to buy too much in route. Extra stuff along the way on an extended trip gets mailed home enabling you to stay on the road without clutter  10. Can be used as a primary or secondary vehicle when not traveling. Great for tailgating.  11. This small Camper Van RV should hold its value better than a larger RV due to escalating fuel prices, high storage prices and higher insurance costs for the bigger RV motorhomes.  12. You don't need a toad (tow vehicle) adding additional expense and set up time when camping and maneuvering around your destination  13. You can park it in your driveway- big plus, no storage fee's  14. You will not pull into a parking lot wondering if you will be able to park or turn around  15. More camping opportunities, many camp grounds do not have spots for the larger motorhomes  16. Great for a trip to your friend's bon-fire and parties- You always have a place to stay without imposing on their home and space. Beside the big benefit of sleeping in your own bed with your own bedding!  17. Of course you save on hotel fees when traveling but with a Transit Connect Camper van you can pull over, sleep and not have to unload to go into a hotel, pack back up and load vehicle again each night. Setting the bed up takes seconds!  18. Using a camper van as a primary vehicle is a wonderful option- less insurance, less cost maintaining multiple vehicles and you can be spontaneous- your gear is with you, spend the night, make a meal, go for that extended hike. Take advantage of your time without having to return home to resupply for your next adventure.  19. A Large Motor home often does not get used many days out of the year. Think about ""cost per use when making your RV purchase decision!  Large home= monthly payment + storage when not in use, + 8 +/- MPG fuel economy, + insurance, + depreciation, + cleaning and maintenance costs, plus higher camp ground fees- full hookups) Consider a $100,000 big Motorhome RV financed with all associated costs that is used 3 weeks per year on average. You will find this RV costing over $1050 per use!  Small Motor home= Higher use, Reduced monthly payment, high MPG fuel economy, less insurance cost (insures like a car), will likely depreciate less, easier to sell if you choose to sell later, clean at home or at gas station car wash, lower camp fees.  NOTE: You must run your own numbers when considering the examples above. 1) Financing 2) how often you use your RV 3) style of camping and other variables will all make a difference in your cost per use.

Car is in great shape, has almost all the options for the year: heated front and rear seats, all three mirrors are auto dimming, memory seats, remote start, back up sensors, and the upgraded Boston sound system.  Two keys, both work and are in good condition.  Car drives great, the hemi pushes the car well, and runs great.  The transmission shifts nice and smooth.  Replaced the front and rear brakes on 9/27.  Tires are about 50%, just changed oil.  No accidents, clean title, I can get a copy of the AutoCheck for those interested.   Price is obo, I work wierd hours, so text is best, if you call I will probably let it go to voicemail and call you back as soon as I can.  You can contact me for any questions or inquiries at nine20-six7six-8four33, Russell.  Thank you for reading!
